# Tutorial_Patch-clamp_data
This tutorial is an example code for patch-clamp measurements which is part of the publication “Bayesian inference of kinetic schemes for ion channels by Kalman filtering”. The work was done in Stan https://mc-stan.org/ with the PyStan https://pystan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ interface version 2.19.1.2 which is currently outdated. We plan to update the tutorial folder to PyStan 3 in the near future. The code is parallelized for the multiple CPUs of a node on a computation cluster. Each individual sampling chain is trivially calculated in parallel provided by the Stan language.

The package contains a file containing the STAN code “KF.txt” as well as the python script  “compile_CCCCO_normal_split.py” to compile the code.  Finally, a Python script “sample_PC_data.py” which acts as the interface between the data and the sampler. To adapt the code to your data, basic Stan programming skills are required. The Python knowledge and the Python scripts are not obligatory, because Stan can interact many high level data analysis programming languages (R, Python, shell, MATLAB, Julia, Stata) .
